The project's objective is to highlight the differences between common approaches to front-end development.

There are two implementations (pure HTML/JS at the /purejs/ subdirectory and jQuery with Bootstrap at the /jQandBS/ subdirectory). These can be simply loaded at static files on browsers by double clicking the index.html (all path to scripts and styles are relative).

They can also be served by any http server simply by declaring the root to the appropriate subdirectory containing the index.html file.
